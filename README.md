## Implementation Details

The Interior360 MVP is built with scalability in mind. The component-based architecture allows for easy extension and customization. Each module (dashboard, client onboarding, etc.) is designed to work both independently and as part of the integrated workflow.

The current implementation uses mock data to demonstrate functionality, with backend integration points prepared for real database connections. The UI is built with TailwindCSS for consistent styling and NextUI components for enhanced interactivity.
